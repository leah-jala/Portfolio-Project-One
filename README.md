# Go Row USA!
## Purpose
While this site was built for the purpose of competing the first Milestone Project for Code Institute's Software Development Course, it was also built with a view to making it a live site to replace a Wix site I made last year in the near future. The related event and email address is fictional, but in the future I plan to hold such events. 

[Go Row USA!](https://leah-jala.github.io/Portfolio-Project-One/index.html) is  designed for junior rowers in the United Kingdom who are thinking about studying and rowing in the United States. Many students and families feel bewildered by the process. This site seeks to present the recruitment process in three stages, including preparation, communication (with coaches) and the further application process once commited to a team. 

The site gives as overview of steps in the process and provides curated links to useful information. The way the timeline is conceptually organized matches the framework/mentality in which rowers train and race. I've tested this concept with rowing friends who immediately recognized this without prompting.

The site is predominantly relevant to women, as the scholarship and grant opportunities in rowing are almost exclusively for women. You can visit the site [here](https://leah-jala.github.io/Portfolio-Project-One/index.html).

The ultimate goal of this site is to give junior rowers the confidence to pursue the recruitment process without investing into expensive agency help.

## User Experience Goals
### First time visitor goals
1. The purpose of the website should be clear.
2. The site should be easy to navigate.
3. It should be easy to return to previously viewed content.
4. It should be clear which part of the site you are on.
5. Links to any social media platforms should be easily found. 
6. It should be easy to find out about events and to make contact with the organizeres. 

### Returning visitor goals
7. A returning user should be able to easily pick up where they left off. 
8. A returning user should easily find event information. 
9. A returning user should easily find social media links and contact information.

### Goals for any visitor
10. The site's theme should match the content of the website and be fun and exciting to look at. 

## Feature response to visitor goals

### Conceptual presentation
Rowers will find the prepare, communication, commit headers familiar as it relates to their training regimes highly. Everyone knows solid training is key to race success - prepare! 

Communication is essential in during a race, and we have a saying that is to "row your own race". It means you should stick to your plan/goals, inspite of what is happening around you. This will help the user see that once they set their goals they need to stick to them. A university team may sound great, but if the institution doesn't meet their academic and/or career goals, it is not an overall good match. This sections helps rowers with the right questions to ask and how to present themselves. 

The last stage, "Commit," lets rowers know what to expect once they commit to a team. When we row in a crew, it is important to be fully commited to get results. There might be a lot of obstacles along the way. Here it is in the form of academic and financial planning, among other things. 

### Logo and page title (Goals 2, 3)
A user can click on the site logo and page title on any page to return to the homepage. This will be clear to the user, because hover properties change the cursor to a hand from a point, and the text, when hovered over, turns blue. From the homepage, users can once again see the site summary for each page, and then use the page links to go directly to the page they need. 


### Navigation menu (Goals 2, 3, 4, 7, 8)
Users can easily navigate the site via the navigation menu and go directly to the pages they want to see. 
- The navigation menu contains links to Home, a Timeline dropdown menu and an events page.
- Users can easily navigate the site, and the dropdown menu assists viewing the site on small screens. 
- A fontawesome star appears on the navigation menu, to help users know where they are. This is also true for the timeline dropdown menu.

![Snip of navigation bar](/docs/readme_images/nav_snip.jpg)

#### Layout and introduction boxes (Goals 2, 3, 4, and 7)
- Each page has similar layout with a top image and an introduction box. It gives the user a predictable place to find the purpose for each page, and it also helps them to see whether they are in the rigth place. 

- The introduction box tells the user what the purpose of the page is. It takes little time to read this information, so you can find out if you are on the page you need without having to read through longer articles. 

- The star icon on the navigation menue gives further confirmation of where a user is on the site, as does the dropdown menu text.

- The homepage hero image differs from the timeline content. This is deliberate as it is more obvious when you have come back to the homepage.

- The events page is unique to the other pages, setting it well apart from the rest of the content. 


### Homepage (All goals)
The homepage provides and overall introduction to the site and provides links to all website pages and social media links. The introduction box tells the visitor what they can expect to find on the overall site.

- Photos on the webcards match the top images of each page they correspond to, which helps the visitor to know they are on the right page. For example, the "Prepare" webcard has an image of girls carrying a boat on their shoulder. When you click through to that page, the same image appears large at the top of the screen.

![Homepage snip](/docs/readme_images/Homepage_snip.jpg)



### Footer (Goals 5 and 9)
- The footer contains links to social media sites and an email address, presented with icons. These icons are so familiar, that I didn't think it was necessary to add any additional text. To me, it looked cleaner without that. 
- This is for the moment a fictional site, so the links on the project site only lead to the main social media websites. In future, the social media links will provide news and information about US university programs, student experiences and events. 
- The links use aria labels for accessibility.

![Screen shot of footer](/docs/readme_images/footer-snip.jpg)

### Fontawesome icons (Goals 1, 2, 7 and 10)
- Fontawesome icons are used through out the site to add clarity to teh content for the visitor, but also to make the experience more fun. Icons are used throughout the site for:
    - The Logo - Used in the header. It is a symbol for water.
    - Navigation menu - A star is used to enhance the American theme to the site. These stars confirm to the visitor where they are on the website. 
    - Articles - The star is further used in place of a normal bullet point to be a bit more fun, and stick to the American theme.  
    - Commit page - A variety of icons are used to match the topic content, to make it visually more interesting. I think that this would also help a returning user to go back to the correct section again. 

#### Color scheme
- The color scheme is based on the American flag colors. I've used this with the hope of enhancing the user experience "fun factor." See credits below. The intention is to make it a lively visual experience for a student, who is interested in going to the United States. The colors match the intent of the content, being US-related, but also because when we think of international sport, we think about national colors. 

### Time line Images
The timeline image follow the prepare (get ready), make contact (get set) and commit (go) theme. When we train and race as rowers there is loads of preparation/traing, the "make contact" relates to the race because communication/teamwork is so essential. As a rower you need to commit to your crew and your race plan to get a good result (go!). The images follow this story. The preparation page shows some rowers carrying their boat after a pracice paddle. The contact image is mid-race. The commit image shows a successful result of winning a medal. This visual story makes the site more interesting, the user more engaged and the content relatable. I tested a few versions of this with rowers before settling on the approach.

### Prepare page
This page summarizes the sorts of things young people should take into consideration when making a big decision about studying abroad. The site does not seek to repeat information that is already in the public domain,b but to help students figure out if going abroad to the US is right for them. The aim is to help rowers identifying some criteria for selecting a university, and to also help them undersand what recruiters are looking for. With this rowers can set recruiting goals, which is important. Recruiters are charming people and would be easy to choose a team because the coach is nice, but end up at a university that doesn't meet their needs. This why I recommend rowers to set goals and stick to them. 

- The first box summarizes points to consider when presenting yourself to teams. This will help rowers make a document to present to recruiters.
- The most viewed page on my current Wix website is about how to write a rowing CV. Box 2, summarizes the information that should be included.
- Beneath this text are 2 resource boxes with loads of further information on recruitment and also standardized tests and where and when to take them in the UK. 
- Favicon stars are used to keep the American theme and add interest.
- The site does

### Contact page
Box one on this page gets rowers to think about the questions they should ask to coaches to find the right team, once they have made their shortlist of universities. 

A box on communication deals with intercultural communication. While Brits and Americans share a language, communication can be quite different. My family has been through this process and we were constantly advised on communication and the importance of not being shy about one's accomplishments. The second on communicating with American coaches advises rowers to be much less "reserved" in their behaviour, and to make certain that any referees for applications do the same. 

Rowers who carefully look at this page should feel confident to contact coaches or to receive cold calls. 

![Snip of contact page](/docs/readme_images/commit_snip.jpg)

### Commit page
Once a rower commits to a university, the coaching team will guide them through the rest of the process and let them know what's needed when. This page helps rowers summarizes the things rowers can expect, and offers more links to further information including offiapplications, fees and grants.
- Links to further information are provided.
- Icons are used to add interest and for quick visual scanning. 

![Snip of commit page](/docs/readme_images/commit_snip.jpg)

### Events page
This is  a fictional page, however if it were to take place, Henley Royal Regatta would be a great place for it. It is the biggest rowing event on the calendar and most elite junior rowers would be participating. 
- There is short introduction about the event in the introduction box.
- There is a simple form with the event details and means to register.
- Users can find contact information without using the footer icon. 
- There is a Google map with the location displayed, which you can click and see in a new browser window. 
- The events page background image is clearly an image of an event. The vast majority of rowers coming to this site will have raced on the Championship course, where all our big head race events happen, and they will recognize that is Hammersmith Bridge. This image will give a sense of occasion to the event page. 


## Design

### Wireframes
I used wireframes for this project. I didn't realize that we could have access to Balsamiq via Code Institute and I had signed up for a trial membership. We subsequently had a death in the family, I had a one-month break from the coure, and when I returned to my work, I discovered I no longer had access to these. 

Although I can not show them here, I would like to reflect that producing them has been a good learning experience. I had to produce them twice, because I did so the first time without enough thought to the volume of my content. I thought too much about how I would like the boxes to sit and how I would like the page too look without thinking about whether the sections would be large enough to accommodate my content. While I was able to stick to my plan for the homepage, I had to change the Prepare page and the Contact page. 

### Small screen focus
Small screen focus: This will eventually be a live site I will use. I built a Wix site a year ago that I was unhappy with, and I plan to replace it with this. My experience is that most people look at my site on their phones. With this in mind, I built the sight first for the small screen and then wrote media queries to accommodate larger screens.

### Colour Scheme
I found my color scheme on a website called [Scheme Color](https://www.schemecolor.com/american-red-white-and-blue.php).  This was incredibly helpful as it provide the major color group for the American red, white and blue theme, shades of those colors and related colors. 

### Fonts
I imported Google fonts as we learned in the Code Institute Love Running walk through. I've used the Roboto font family. I looked through a number of American sports sites like ESPN and WNBA and found that the fonts were quite plain. I looked at the sort of fonts you relate to American varsity sport, and while they weren't available for free, I also thought they would be distracting. In the end, I tried a few different fonts and liked Roboto the best for my site. I need to spend more time exploring fonts and the way they affect user experiences. I feel the font I have is clean looking and does not distract from the content and is most importantly easy to read as I have a lot of text on some of the pages. 

### Images
My goals was to have responsive images that needed as few media queries as possible. I needed to apply height rules in the media queries. I would like to learn how to make images responsive, if possible.

## Responsiveness

To test responsiveness, I opened the Chrome developer tools and used the inspect tool to test each page from 300px to full screen, and I also tested it on an [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) website

![Snip from Am I Responsive](/docs/readme_images/responsive.jpg)

### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse to generate reports to audit performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO for mobile and desktops. The first reports I had were low on performance (under 70%) because my image sizes were far too large. I also had to do some minor work to provide the equivalent of the "alt text" on background images.
- Desktop results

## Deployment


## Credits and Acknowledgments

### Overall Advice
I would like to thank my mentor Daisy McGirr for outstanding guidance on this project. She gave me links to resources, and I have used her Milestone Project One README file for guidance on how to organize the document and what to include. 

I relied heavily on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) reference materials throughout the project to check I was using the correct properties or for a refresher. 

### Set up
I relied on the Love Running walkthrough project to initially get this website set up with github and gitpod. 

### Navbar
I used the Love Running nav bar as a model to initially make my navigation bar and menu.

I used the W3 Schools Tutorial ["Create A Dropdown Navbar](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_dropdown_navbar) to create the dropdown button on my NavBar menu.

### Use of grid and flexbox
CSS Tricks was an amazing resource for setting up grid and flex layouts and setting properties. 

Stack Overflow helped me with a soluatio to [Prevent grid from overflowing] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43311943/prevent-content-from-expanding-grid-items)

I referred [How the minmax() Function works](https://bitsofco.de/how-the-minmax-function-works/)

### Event page
I watched a LinkedIn Tutorial called, "Building Responsive Forms with Flexbox", by James Williamson to help me build a responsive form. 

The Google map was inbeed with the help of the tutorial, ["Create Responsive Google Maps on Any Website,"] (https://ostraining.com/blog/coding/responsive-google-maps/) by Valentina Garcia
