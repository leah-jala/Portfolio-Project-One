# Go Row USA!
## Purpose
While this site was built for the purpose of competing the first Milestone Project for Code Institute's Software Development Course, it was also built with a view to making it a live site to replace a Wix site I made last year in the near future. The related event and email address is fictional, but in the future I plan to hold such events. 

[Go Row USA!](https://leah-jala.github.io/Portfolio-Project-One/index.html) is  designed for junior rowers in the United Kingdom who are thinking about studying and rowing in the United States. Many students and families feel bewildered by the process. This site seeks to present the recruitment process in three stages, including preparation, communication (with coaches) and the further application process once commited to a team. 

The site gives as overview of steps in the process and provides curated links to useful information. The way the timeline is conceptually organized matches the framework/mentality in which rowers train and race. I've tested this concept with rowing friends who immediately recognized this without prompting.

The site is predominantly relevant to women, as the scholarship and grant opportunities in rowing are almost exclusively for women. You can visit the site [here](https://leah-jala.github.io/Portfolio-Project-One/index.html).

## User Experience Goals
### First time visitor goals
1. The purpose of the website should be clear.
2. The site should be easy to navigate.
3. It should be easy to return to previously viewed content.
4. It should be clear which part of the site you are on.
5. Links to any social media platforms should be easily found. 
6. It should be easy to find out about events and to make contact with the organizeres. 

### Returning user goals
7. A returning user should be able to easily pick up where they left off. 
8. A returning user should easily find event information. 
9. A returning user should easily find social media links and contact information.

## Feature response to user goals

### Logo and page title (Goals 2, 3)
A user can on any page click on the site logo and page title and return to the homepage. From the homepage, users can once again see the site summary for each page, and then use the page links to go directly to the page they need. 


### Navigation menu (Goals 2, 3, 4, 7, 8)
Users can easily navigate the site via the navigation menu and go directly to the pages they want to see. 
- The navigation menu contains links to Home, a Timeline dropdown menu and an events page.
- Users can easily navigate the site, and the dropdown menu assists viewing the site on small screens. 
- A fontawesome star appears on the navigation menu, to help users know where they are. This is also true for the timeline dropdown menu.

### Footer
- The footer contains links to social media sites and an email address, presented with icons. These icons are so familiar, that I didn't think it was necessary to add any additional text. To me, it looked cleaner without that. 
- This is for the moment a fictional site, so the links on the project site only lead to the main social media websites. In future, the social media links will provide news and information about US university programs, student experiences and events. 
- The links use aria labels for accessibility.

#### Favicons
- Favicons are used through out the site.
- Logo - Use in the header, nav bar.
- Site wide - for visual interest.
- Navigation bar - to assist user in knowing where they are on the site. 

#### Color scheme
- The color scheme is on an American red, white and blue US flag scheme with the hope of enhancing the user experience fun factor. See credits below.

#### Layout
- Each page has similar layout of an image and an introduction box. It gives user a purpose for each page. The timeline, or stage, page images duplicate the ones used on the landing page for each relevant stage, confirming users are in the right place.

### Landing page
- The landing page gives users a general introduction to the site and a short summary of what to expect from each page of the main content, which is the timeline stages. 
- Photos on the webcards match the top images of each page they relate to. As mentioned above, this helps the user know they are in the right place.

### All timeline pages
- The top/hero image of the page duplicates the one on the homepage, letting users know they are in the right place. 

### Prepare page

-This page summarizes the sorts of things young people should take into consideration when making a big decision about studying abroad. The aim is to help rowers make a short list and set recruiting goals.
- The page summarizes points to consider when presenting yourself to teams. This will help rowers make a document to present to recruiters.
- Beneath this text are 2 resource boxes with loads of further information on recruitment and also standardized tests and where and when to take them in the UK. 
- Favicon stars are used to keep the American theme and add interest.

### Contact page
- This page gets rowers to think about the sort of questions they should ask to coaches to find the right fit. There is also a box for communicating to American coaches who expect much less "reserved" behaviour, when it comes to showing excitement and enthusiasm.

### Commit page
- This page summarizes the things rowers can expect once they commit to a team, including applications, fees and grants.
- Links to further information are provided.
- Favicons are used to add interest and for quick visual scanning.

### Events page
- This is for the present a fictional page, however if it were to take place, Henley Royal Regatta would be a great place for it as a lot of elite junior rowers would be present. 
- There is short introduction to the event in the introduction box and a simple form with the event details and means to register. 

FIX THE RADIO BUTTONS AND ADD AN IMAGE.


## Design

### Wireframes

### Images
- Small screen focus: This will eventually be a live site I will use. I built a Wix site a year ago that I was unhappy with, and I plan to replace it with this. My experience is that most people look at my site on their phones. With this in mind, I built the sight first for the small screen and then larger ones, and created my media queries to adapt to larger screens instead of smaller.
- Conceptual structure supported by images: Rowers will recognize the prepare, communication, commit headers from their training regimes. The images support this too. The first image is post training, the second of the middle of a race and the third is the result. Communication is essential in during a race, and we have a saying that is to "row your own race". It means you should stick to your plan/goals, inspite of what is happening around you. So, with regard to the site, ussers should set their goals/plan in the prepare phase, stick to those goals and communicate them well in the communication stage, and finally come to a good result. The events page photo is clearly an image of an event. The vast majority of rowers coming to this site will have raced on the Championship course, where all our big head race events happen, and they will recognize that is Hammersmith Bridge.

### Responsiveness

![Snip from Am I Responsive](/docs/readme_images/responsive.jpg)
### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse to generate reports to audit performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO for mobile and desktops. The first reports I had were low on performance (under 70%) because my image sizes were far too large. I also had to do some minor work to provide the equivalent of the "alt text" on background images.
- Desktop results
