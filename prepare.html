                <h2>Prepare</h2>
                <p>Before you get started, think about why you would like to study in the US. Is it the best option for
                    your
                    future?
                    What do you need from a university? What are coaches looking for? Set goals based on these, and
                    questions
                    like the ones below, and stick to them.

                    <p>Before you speak to teams, think about the practical issues that will influence whether or not a
                        particular university will be a choice for you? Below is a list of things you might take into
                        consideration.
                        Is there anything you would add to this list? What would be a deal-breaker for you?

                <h3>What are ACTs & SATs?</h3>
                <p> US students don't take a test like the A Level. Instead, universities
                    require
                    students to take either the ACT or the SAT, which are standardized tests in reading comprehension,
                    grammar and maths.
                    You'll find links to advice on when and where to
                    take the test and how to prepare. <br>
