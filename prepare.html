            <h2>Prepare</h2>
            <p>Before you get started, think about why you would like to study in the US. Is it the best option for your
                future?
                What do you need from a university? What are coaches looking for? Set goals based on these, and
                questions
                like the ones below, and stick to them.

                <h3>Which university is right for you?</h3>
                <p>Before you speak to teams, think about the practical issues that will influence whether or not a
                    particular university will be a choice for you? Below is a list of things you might take into
                    consideration.
                    Is there anything you would add to this list? What would be a deal-breaker for you?

                    Whether or not you have a rowing CV, coaches will still ask you to fill out their own recruiting

                    something ready to send off at a moment's notice.</p>

            <h3>What are ACTs & SATs?</h3>
            <p> US students don't take a test like the A Level. Instead, universities
                require
                students to take either the ACT or the SAT, which are standardized tests in reading comprehension,
                grammar and maths.
                You'll find links to advice on when and where to
                take the test and how to prepare. <br>

            <p>There is a lot of information and also agencies who sell services to help you
                along. You don't need to invest into recruitment itself, as US coaches will keep you informed
