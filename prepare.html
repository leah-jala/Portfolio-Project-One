            <h2>Prepare</h2>
            <p>Before you get started, think about why you would like to study in the US. Is it the best option for your
                future?
                What do you need to know about the university? What are coaches looking for? What do you need to know
                about the team?
                Set goals and priorities and stick to them.

                    <p>Before you speak to teams, think about the practical issues that will influence whether or not a
                        particular university will be a choice for you? Below is a list of things you might take into
                        consideration.
                        Is there anything you would add to this list? What would be a deal-breaker for you?

                        Whether or not you have a rowing CV, coaches will still ask you to fill out their own recruiting form, but it's nice to have 
                        something ready to send off at a moment's notice.</p>

                            but were made optional or waived during Covid. There has been some talk of phasing them out altogether. Many universities give you a 
                            choice between one or the other. The SAT has the benefit of having a free SAT practice materials via Khan Academy (see Further Resources).

                            you can do so easily by uploading it to YouTube and providing a link to coaches. You can do this using private settings. Make sure that it is good quality. Ask your coach to take some video during training.</p>
