            <h2>Prepare</h2>
            <p>Before you get started, think about why you would like to study in the US. Is it the best option for your
                future?
                What do you need to know about the university? What are coaches looking for? What do you need to know
                about the team?
                Set goals and priorities and stick to them.

                    <h3>Which university is right for you?</h3>
                    <p>Before you speak to teams, think about the practical issues that will influence whether or not a
                        particular university will be a choice for you? Below is a list of things you might take into
                        consideration.
                        Is there anything you would add to this list? What would be a deal-breaker for you?

                    <p>There are all sorts of ways to do this. You can prepare a document to use as an attachment or create a free website.</a>
                        Whether or not you have a rowing CV, coaches will still ask you to fill out their own recruiting form, but it's nice to have 
                        something ready to send off at a moment's notice.</p>
