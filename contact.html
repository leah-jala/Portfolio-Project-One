                <h2>Make Contact</h2>
                <p>Once you've decided it go ahead, it's time to contact teams at the universities that interest you.
                    Find out if you're a good fit for each other by speaking to coaches, team members and
                    ideally, by making campus visits. Think about your goals and consider what questions you
                    should ask them? Your style of communication will be important.

                    <p>Recruitment is a two-way process, and you are also interviewing
                        them. What do you need to now find out to determine if the team is a good fit? Avoid
                        asking questions you can easily find answers to on their website. Review the goals you made 
                        in stage one and prepare a list.

                    <p id="quote"><em><strong>"You need to be much more animated verbally and in email. Compared to Brits, Americans are very gung-ho!"</strong></em><br>Annalisa, Tideway Scullers School, 2021</p>
                </div>
                <p>This is not the right time to be modest. There's a lot of competition for about
                    10-15 places on a team. The coaches will only know what you choose to tell them, so it is
                    not the time to be modest. Coaches also need to build a case for the Admissions team as to why they
                    should accept you. Show pride in your rowing, academic and any other extra-curricular
                    successes.</p>
                <p>Youâ€™ll need teacher recommendations for your university application, so you'll need to give your
                    teachers similar advice. American teachers will write sentences like, <em>"This is the best student
                        of my career."</em>  The bottom line is that coaches are looking for rowers who are excited about being part of
                    their team. You need to communicate that excitement. </p>
                    
                    <p>Don't make them wonder if you are
                        interested or why you want or deserve to be on the team. This doesn't mean that you can't be honest about
                        any concerns you have. Just be open and honest!</p>
