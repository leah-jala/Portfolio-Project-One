                <h2>Make Contact</h2>
                <p>Once you've decided it go ahead, it's time to contact teams at the universities that interest you.
                    Find out if you're a good fit for each other by speaking to coaches, team members and
                    ideally, by making campus visits. Think about your goals, and consider what questions you
                    should ask them? Think about how you will present yourself.

                    <p>Remember that recruitment is a two-way process, and you are also interviewing
                        them. You've thought about what you want from a university and team in the last
                        section. What do you need to now find out to determine if it's a good fit? Avoid
                        asking questions you can easily find answers to on their website.

                <h3>Sing your praises</h3>
                <img src="#" alt="To be inserted">
                <p>This is not the right time to be understated. There's a lot of competition for about
                    10-15 places on a team. The coaches will only know what you choose to tell them, so it is
                    not the time to be modest. Coaches need to build a case for the Admissions team as to why they
                    should accept you.
                    Let the coaches know about your rowing, academic and any other extra-curricular successes. </p>
                <p>You’ll need teacher recommendations for your university application, you'll want to give your
                    teachers similar advice. American teachers will write sentences like, <em>"This is the best
                        student of my career."</em></p>
                <p>
                    The bottom line is that coaches are looking for rowers who are excited about being part of
                    their team. You need to communicate that excitement. Don't make them wonder if you’re
                    interested or why you want or deserve to be on the team.
                </p>
