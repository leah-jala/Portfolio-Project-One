                <p>You will be asked to commit to one university, and they will guide you through the rest of the

                    Depending on the university, you may make early applications for admission and any grants or

                        incredibly
                        varied
                        experience among recruits. Some are asked to commit in year 11, only having just begun the
                        process,
                        whereas others didn't decide until the summer of year 12. Most teams will ask for a decision in
                        the Spring.

                        during Covid, and there was some talk of eliminating them. Find out if they are still required.

                    <p>Anywhere from the spring or summer before year 13, you will be given information about costs,
                        grants and scholarships. Ivy League universities and some other private universities offer
                        needs-based grants, but only some extend this to international students. Beware that rowing
                        scholarships are limited, merit-based and not always offered to incoming students. Don’t forget
                        you may qualify for academic scholarships.

                    <p>Title IX is a civil rights law passed in 1972 that prohibited sex-based discrimmination in any
                        education programme
                        that receives US federal funding. This extends to sports, but it doesn't necessitate equal
                        funding within each sport.
                        Women's rowing is one of the sports that has benefited, and for this reason, there are many more
                        opportunities for
                        rowing scholarships for women than men. You can find out more about Title IX on the

                    <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> Applying</h3>
                    <p>Most universities offer some form of an "Early Action" application, which has a deadline in
                        October. You will most likely be asked to do this. Applications are generally through <a
                            href="https://www.commonapp.org/" target="_blank">Common Application</a>. Admissions
                        requirements and deadlines are clearly spelled out on university websites.
                        While some universities will accept your appliations early, others have a universal decision
                        date for all students.

                    <p>Once you're accepted, you can focus in on keeping your grades up. Keep an eye on your email
                        as there will be lots of matriculation forms to fill in related to things like housing,
                        orientation,
                        health requirements and course selection. Beware that the NHS will not cover physical exams,
                        extra
                        vaccinations and blood tests, which get expensive when done privately, so plan for it.
                        Otherwise, keep in
                        communication with your coach on your progress and races, and make sure to following the
